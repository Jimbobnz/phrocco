Phrocco is the start of a port of the rather nice literate documentation generator Docco to PHP

    http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/


### Installing

Best done via composer global.

    composer global require rossriley/phrocco:dev-master

This will install the binary to ~/.composer/vendor/bin/phrocco.

The project is in alpha at this stage but feedback and pull requests are welcome.

Also check out the front end site http://phrocco.info/ for more instructions and example output.
